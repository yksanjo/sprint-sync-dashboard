Title: I built a Sprint Sync Dashboard that aggregates GitHub, Jira/Linear, and Slack metrics

Body:
I've been working on a tool that helps development teams track sprint health automatically. It:
- Posts daily summaries to Slack
- Calculates PR health scores
- Detects anomalies (stale PRs, blockers, etc.)
- Works with GitHub Actions (zero config)

Built with TypeScript, uses GraphQL APIs, and integrates with Slack Block Kit.

Would love feedback from the community! 🚀
